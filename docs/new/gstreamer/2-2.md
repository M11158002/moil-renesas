# 2-2 Generating Remap Mapping Files

We aim to develop a GStreamer filter to transform fisheye images into corrected single-angle or equirectangular images. This transformation requires reading a set of X, Y mapping tables to reposition each point, known as remap maps.

Since MOIL fisheye image Anypoint and Panorama calculations involve trigonometric functions, performance would be better on PCs with NVidia GPUs. However, targeting on Renesas RZ/G2L, we will first pre-calculate these maps and perform only remap operations at runtime for optimal performance.

To generate these remap maps on a PC, please download, compile, and run the following GitHub project:

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/cjchng/mainmoil_6view](https://github.com/cjchng/mainmoil_6view) (private)

Configure the parameters according to your camera, execute the program and select:

```bash
4. Full Map
```

This will generate usable X, Y maps.

:::tip [Fisheye Camera Parameters]
Ensure the fisheye camera parameters are set in the program before generating maps for correct equirectangular transformation from the connected fisheye camera.

:::tip
If you don't have a fisheye camera with the calibration parameters, you can skip this step and use the
ready-made X,Y Maps in the next section.
