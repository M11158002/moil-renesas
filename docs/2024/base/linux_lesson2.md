# **Linux: Second Lesson - File Manipulation, Searching, and Text Processing**

## **1. Review of First Lesson**

Before diving into new concepts, let's quickly review some important commands from the first lesson:

- **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory.
- **`ls`**: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- **`cd`**: Changes the directory.
- **`touch`**: Creates an empty file.
- **`mkdir`**: Creates a directory.
- **`cp`**: Copies files or directories.
- **`mv`**: Moves or renames files or directories.
- **`rm`**: Removes files or directories.
- **`cat`**: Displays the contents of a file.
- **`man`**: Displays the manual for a command.

Now that you've learned the basics of navigating and managing files, it's time to learn about:

1. Searching for files
2. More advanced file management
3. Working with text files and text-processing tools

## **2. Searching for Files**

Sometimes, you need to find specific files or directories on your system. Linux provides powerful tools to search for files.

### **`find`** – Search for Files or Directories

The `find` command allows you to search for files and directories within a directory hierarchy.

- Basic syntax:
  ```bash
  find <path> -name <filename>
  ```

- Example: Search for a file named `example.txt` in the `/home` directory.
  ```bash
  $ find /home -name example.txt
  ```

- You can use wildcard characters (`*`):
  ```bash
  $ find /home -name "*.txt"  # Find all .txt files in /home
  ```

- To search by file type (e.g., only directories):
  ```bash
  $ find /home -type d  # Find directories only
  ```

### **`locate`** – Fast Search (Using a Database)

`locate` is faster than `find` because it uses a pre-built database of filenames. However, the database needs to be updated regularly using the `updatedb` command.

- Basic syntax:
  ```bash
  locate <filename>
  ```

- Example:
  ```bash
  $ locate example.txt
  ```

- If the database is out of date, you may need to run:
  ```bash
  $ sudo updatedb
  ```

### **`which`** – Find the Path of Executable Commands

The `which` command helps you find the location of executables. For example:

```bash
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
```

This tells you where the Python executable is located on your system.

## **3. Working with Directories and Files**

### **`rmdir`** – Remove an Empty Directory

While `rm` can remove files, `rmdir` is specifically used for removing empty directories.

- Example:
  ```bash
  $ rmdir empty_directory
  ```

If you try to remove a non-empty directory with `rmdir`, you will get an error. In that case, use `rm -r` (recursive) to remove the directory and its contents.

- Example:
  ```bash
  $ rm -r non_empty_directory
  ```

### **`tar`** – Compressing and Archiving Files

In Linux, you often need to compress or archive files for storage or transfer. The `tar` command is used for both creating archives and extracting them.

- To create a tar archive:
  ```bash
  $ tar -cvf archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- To extract the contents of a tar archive:
  ```bash
  $ tar -xvf archive.tar
  ```

- To create a compressed tar archive:
  ```bash
  $ tar -czvf archive.tar.gz directory_name
  ```

- To extract a compressed tar archive:
  ```bash
  $ tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz
  ```

### **`zip` and `unzip`** – Working with ZIP Archives

The `zip` and `unzip` commands are used for working with `.zip` files, which are commonly used for file compression.

- To create a zip file:
  ```bash
  $ zip archive.zip file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- To unzip a zip file:
  ```bash
  $ unzip archive.zip
  ```

## **4. Text Processing Tools**

Text processing is one of the most powerful aspects of using Linux. Let's explore some useful tools for working with text files.

### **`grep`** – Search for Text Patterns

The `grep` command is used to search for specific text patterns within a file.

- Basic syntax:
  ```bash
  grep <pattern> <file>
  ```

- Example: Search for the word "error" in a log file:
  ```bash
  $ grep "error" logfile.txt
  ```

- Use `grep -r` to search recursively through directories:
  ```bash
  $ grep -r "error" /var/log
  ```

- Case-insensitive search with `-i`:
  ```bash
  $ grep -i "error" logfile.txt
  ```

### **`sed`** – Stream Editor for Text Manipulation

`sed` is a stream editor used for basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).

- Basic syntax:
  ```bash
  sed 's/old_text/new_text/' <file>
  ```

- Example: Replace "apple" with "orange" in `fruits.txt`:
  ```bash
  $ sed 's/apple/orange/' fruits.txt
  ```

- To save the changes to the file:
  ```bash
  $ sed -i 's/apple/orange/' fruits.txt
  ```

### **`awk`** – Pattern Scanning and Processing Language

`awk` is a powerful text-processing tool that allows you to manipulate and process text data, often used in reports or logs.

- Basic syntax:
  ```bash
  awk '{print $1}' <file>
  ```

- Example: Print the first column (field) of a CSV file:
  ```bash
  $ awk -F "," '{print $1}' data.csv
  ```

- To perform calculations with `awk`:
  ```bash
  $ awk '{print $1 + $2}' data.txt
  ```

### **`sort`** – Sorting Data

The `sort` command sorts lines of text files.

- Example: Sort a list of names in a file:
  ```bash
  $ sort names.txt
  ```

- Sort in reverse order:
  ```bash
  $ sort -r names.txt
  ```

- Sort numerically:
  ```bash
  $ sort -n numbers.txt
  ```

## **5. File Permissions and Ownership**

### **`chmod`** – Change File Permissions

`chmod` is used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

- Example: Give the owner read and write permissions, and others read-only:
  ```bash
  $ chmod 644 example.txt
  ```

- Explanation of `644`: The first digit is for the owner, the second for the group, and the third for others. Each digit corresponds to the sum of permissions:
  - `4` = read (r)
  - `2` = write (w)
  - `1` = execute (x)

### **`chown`** – Change Ownership

`chown` changes the owner and group of a file or directory.

- Example:
  ```bash
  $ sudo chown user:group file.txt
  ```

## **6. Practice Tasks**

1. **Searching for Files**: Use the `find` command to locate all `.txt` files in your home directory.
2. **File Permissions**: Change the permissions of a file so that only the owner can write to it, and others can only read it.
3. **Compress Files**: Create a `.tar.gz` archive of a directory, then extract it to a new location.
4. **Text Processing**: Use `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` to search for patterns and manipulate text in files.

## **7. Summary**

In this lesson, we've learned:

- How to search for files using `find`, `locate`, and `which`.
- How to manage files and directories with commands like `rmdir`, `tar`, `zip`, and `unzip`.
- How to process text files using powerful tools such as `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`.
- Basic file permissions and how to modify them with `chmod` and `chown`.

These tools are essential for efficiently working with Linux. In future lessons, we will build on these skills, diving deeper into scripting and automating tasks.
