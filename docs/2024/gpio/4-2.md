# 4-2 Linux GPIO Driver

sysfs is a pseudo file system provided by the Linux kernel that exports information about various kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and associated device drivers from the kernel's device model to user space through virtual files. In addition to providing information about various devices and kernel subsystems, exported virtual files are also used for their configuration.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs>

In Linux, we usually use these 2 simple commands to access files  

- READ content from a file

```bash
cat filename
```

- WRITE content to a file

```bash
echo xxx > filename
```

**Linux GPIO Sysfs Interface**  

Please reference to the document first,

<https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt>

The important steps:

1. Ask kernel for the control privilege

/sys/class/gpio/

for example, to get the control privilege of GPIO19

```bash
cd /sys/class/gpio
echo 19 > export  
```

2. Set read/write direction,  

/sys/class/gpio/gpioN/

For example,  

```bash
echo "out" direction
```

We actually input the below Linux commands on Renesas RZ/G2L  

```bash
cd /sys/class/gpio
echo 19 > export
```

We would get the below error message:  

```bash
invalid argument
```

Since that GPIO number doesn't exist,
